# Project Amnesty

The goal of this project was to help out a fellow Political Science student with her Honors Thesis. Her goal was to determine if whether a country achieved amnesty post-war had an effect on certain features and performances of the country in the future. Through the visualizations created, hopefully a nice conclusion was drawn.
